Hi! I'm Rui, and this is my blog/personal page!
</p>

## The Blog

So, what i'm trying to do here is a sort of blog where I can talk about what interest me. Be it about school, projects, technology in general, engineering, food. Well, just about anything that atracts my atention.

Mostly this will be kind of an experiment for me, to see if i'm actually capable of maitaining this blog up with some regularity. I hope soo. We'll see. :P


## About me

So, about me.

I'm currently a Grad student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, in Lisbon. My main interests lie in computer architectures, hardware acceleration, algorithms, computer networks, optimization and more recently Artificial Inteligence and machine learning (I'll be expanding on those this year!). I also have an interest in systems and network security, parallel programing. You know, the usual Computer Engineering stuff...

On my free time I love traveling, and have already met a good (but never enough!) share of European countries, and some of the Americas. I'll even be spending next semester abroad in Belgium's KUL, so that's going to be cool! I also recently began running, and have already completed my first Half-Marathon. I love reading (mostly Sci-Fy and Fantasy) and catching up on my favourite shows. And obviously, the obligatory spending time with my friends :)

If you want to contact me, feel free to hit me up on <a href = "twitter.com/rui278">twitter</a>!

Thanks for reading! And I hope you enjoy this new experiment!

(p.s. thanks to Ricardo for the about pic photoshop and Artur for the favicon :D )
