A friend of mine made a youtube video of one of his bike trips, and I thought it was really cool, so it really got me in the mood to try to make a small video of my own, for the first time. So i did this.
(Sorry in advance for the horizontal video!(and general lack of quality... Its my first time doing this kind of things!))
