So, a while ago I saw a reddit AMA*: [IE team AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/) from the Internet Explorer Team, at Microsoft. It was a nice thread, though the prevalent sentiment towards Internet Explorer was, as expected, one of dismissal and mockery. I say that including myself in the bunch. The last time i used internet explorer for any purpose other than downloading Chrome or firefox was…. well… i don’t know. I honestly can’t remember. Maybe 08? At that time IE really was terrible in comparison with other browsers. And it stayed that way for a few years. To the point that almost no one one tech savvy enough to download a third party browse used IE. And that’s why it’s usage percentages went from a dominating seventy percent share of browser usage in 09 to a meagre twenty odd percent share in 2014.

 At this point almost anyone mocks and has a terrible image of IE.

So, the mood was set. I went into the AMA expecting some interesting answers from a Microsoft Team, some IE jokes, and not much more.

Now, one of the questions from the AMA was a simple: Why should i use IE? The answer was something along the lines of:
-We’re never going to be able to convince you of how much IE has evolved just by shouting out some features and benchmarks, so i’d just say: Just try it out.

And for me that was a pretty compelling answer. It really showed confidence in the product and it’s state. So i went to try it out. 

And it went well. IE is really much faster than it used to be. Honestly, in terms of usability and speed it seems to be on par with the competition. Pages load fast. Scroll is buttery smooth. It even renders pages better than my Chrome installation (though there is something wrong with my Chrome in particular, that keeps breaking up on some pages, though it seems to be particular to me).
 
So fully convinced of the desktop performance i went to check our their second claim (during the thread they claimed this also in some responses): seamless integration between devices. 

And here’s where it all falls apart. By this i mean: Chrome has it all under its helm. Favourites sync between all my devices and so do passwords, usernames, logins and history. And IE claims it can also do so. And honestly, i don't question it. The only problem is, IE lacks in availabilty. 

Sure I am a particularly difficult case to appease. I have my windows 8 desktop, my macBook Air laptop, my Android Smartphone, my Iphone 5c and occasional dalliances into various linux distros. The thing is, Chrome works on all of them. And syncs on all of them. And performs equally well. IE works on my desktop. And that’s all. I expected the competitiveness from IE on this front, and I found nothing.

Well, almost nothing. Windows’ concept of devices is the XBox One, Windows Desktops, Windows Phone and RT. And that leaves a very big chunk of users without any oficial option for their devices. And for me that’s a dealbreaker, it makes IE a no go.

My conclusion is really simple. The browser for desktop looks amazing and works accordingly. But they clearly have an availability problem that they need to solve before they can see relevant migration. Nowadays it’s all about creating cross platform environments, that will allow you to navigate devices while keeping your data and settings intact and with no effort. Chrome manages it. Firefox manages it. IE does not. And for that it still lags behind those two browsers.
