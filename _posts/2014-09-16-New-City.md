So this semester I’m going to be studying abroad at K.U.Leuven’s Faculty of Engineering Sciences (I’m originally from Lisbon University’s Instituto Superior Técnico).

My first impression upon arrival was that it was a very small city. Which, for a Portuguese is a 
rare thing to say. Lisbon, where I come from, is not a particularly large city. At 1.6 - 2 million 
people, we can never be called small, but also not that big comparing to other cities. Leuven 
on the other hand is a 100 thousand people city. Its a circular shaped city with a radius of 2 
kilometers, and from what I’ve seen generally very small buildings (two to three stories max).
Though the city itself is gorgeous. It’s very picturesque and cosy, though could be more if the buildings were bigger. 

Combined with the general lack of hills it gives the city the feel of being very small. You look any direction and you only see the small building you’re looking at and then the sky. Something I’m not at all used to. In lisbon you see either tall buildings or small buildings and the hills around it with more houses! This new way still feels somewhat weird! :P. Also, most buildings are brownstone, which is gives the city a nice look, and there are a lot of buildings you can see are centuries old:

The other very noteworthy thing, though expected, is the shear amount of bikes. Its a small and generally flat city, so bikes are very convenient. And the city has great infrastructure to accommodate them, like this underground bike park:

It’s a great method of transportation that i hope to adopt!

Update(16/9)! Here's my bike!

As for the people, they seem generally nice and I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t know english to an extent that we cannot communicate, so that’s great. The bad part is that i still haven't met anyone… It’s to be expected though, I arrived yesterday and my housemates (there are 6 of us in this house) haven't arrived yet. I only came this soon because of Erasmus Orientation Days in this next week (classes only start on the 22nd).

The only bad thing up to now is that i tried registering at the university yesterday (friday), but there was some sort of informatic error and I (and as i was told, several other exchange students) couldn't register. As a consequence, this will be a internet-less weekend, as i need my university credentials to login… This is also the reason why this post is only up today (and why I couldn’t go to some ESN meetups: No access to facebook!), but was written on the 13th. Well, it’ll be sorted out next week!

All in all, i think I’ll like it here, and i can’t wait to meet new people, but i need my internet fix!
