So, for those who don’t know, last year, around may I started running. First I ran just by myself, but then in March I ran my first Half-Marathon, but I’d never ran an official 10k race. So I thought I could accomplish that, plus add another country to the list of countries where i’ve ran (So far, Brazil, Portugal and Belgium :P). Then I decided to add another goal, and have an official sub-60 race. 

So with all that in mind, I joined [this](http://www.sport.be/runningtour/dwarsdoormechelen/2014/nl/) and made a race out of it.

Now, bear in mind, I’d just arrived to a new country, so between the usual confusion of moving and settling in and parties that ensue the first few weeks here, I had ran a grand total of one time in the 15 day before the race. Fortunately that was compensated by the flatness of the terrain (total of 70m elevation for the whole race), and so I was able to reach my goal, with a 59:30 official time. Not too bad. It could have been better, as around the 9.3Km mark the race trajectory passed right next to the finish line, and thinking it was almost ready, I ran those “last” hundred meters at full speed. And that was terrible, as the subsequent 600m were terrible. I feel I could have stayed comfortably in the 58’s or even late 57’s if I hadn’t got confused and exhausted myself on that fake ending. But all in all it was a good race, and my three goals were reached, so I was happy :D! ![Me and a Medal](/assets/2014-09-28 14.22.29.jpg)

Now off to start training for my [next race](http://www.saosilvestredelisboa.com/site/): where I’ll try to - at least - do a sub-55, and maybe, just a big unlikely maybe, do a sub 50. We’ll see!

So, for not that's all on my running activities :P
